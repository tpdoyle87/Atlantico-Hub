          <br>
          <p> Very few people understands how the exchange calculates margin requirements and how the brokers use investment firm's assets to cover their margin calls.
          <p><strong>Atlantico Hub was created to shed lights into the guarantee selection process.</strong></p>
          <p>Our clients have visibilty over the margin requirements generated by their trades and the ability to pick and choose, beforehand, what they want to use as guarantee.</p>
          <p>We love automation but, above all, we love people and want them to have as much free time as possible for relevant things in life.
          Our clients can count on the <em>Atlantico Expert's</em> team to help them figure out how to better solve their guarantee selection problems and save a lot of money along the way.</p>
